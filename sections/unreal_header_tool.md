Unreal Header Tool (UHT[^2]) is a code generator and reflection system in Unreal Engine. It processes special macros and meta tags in C++ header files and generates additional code to support Unreal Engine's reflection system, which enables various engine features like Blueprint integration, serialization, networking, and more.

-   `EditFixedSize`: Specifies that an `TArray` or `TMap` property should be editable in the Details Panel of the Unreal Editor with a fixed number of elements, preventing addition or removal.
-   `Transient`: Indicates that a property should not be serialized, making it non-persistent and not saved when saving the state of the object.
-   `Replicated`: Automatically replicates the property's value to clients in a multiplayer environment when the property changes on the server.
-   `ReplicatedUsing`: Specifies a custom function that should be called on both the server and clients to handle replication of the property's value.

-   `AdvancedDisplay`: Indicates that the property's value should be displayed with advanced options in editor UI.
-   `Config`: Marks the property to be serialized to the project configuration file for external customization.
-   `GlobalConfig`: Marks the property to be serialized to the global configuration file for external customization across all projects.

#### Meta tags

-   `DisplayName`: Sets a custom display name for the property in the Unreal Editor.
-   `Tooltip`: Provides a tooltip description for the property in the Unreal Editor.
-   `ClampMin`: Sets the minimum allowed value for the property in the Unreal Editor.
-   `ClampMax`: Sets the maximum allowed value for the property in the Unreal Editor.
-   `AllowPrivateAccess`: Allows access to private members within the class it belongs to.

```

```cpp
UPROPERTY(Transient, Replicated)
int32 CurrentHealth;

UPROPERTY(Transient, ReplicatedUsing=OnArmorChanged)
int32 CurrentArmor;

UFUNCTION()
void OnArmorChanged();
```

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, SimpleDisplay)
int32 MaxHealth = 100;

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, AdvancedDisplay)
float HealthRegenerationTime = 5.0f;
```

```cpp
// Must mark UCLASS with Config specifier

// Config can be overriden from the base class.
UPROPERTY(Config, BlueprintReadOnly)
bool bRegenerateHealth;

// GlobalConfig CANNOT be overridden from the base class.
UPROPERTY(GlobalConfig, BlueprintReadOnly)
bool bEnableHealthSimulation;
```

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, EditFixedSize)
TArray<FName> Usernames = { TEXT("JohnDoe"), TEXT("MrRobin"), TEXT("JaneDoe") };

### UFUNCTION

`UFUNCTION` is a macro used to declare a function within a class that needs to be exposed to the Unreal Engine's reflection system. It allows the function to be used in Blueprint scripts and network replication.

#### Common Specifiers

-   `BlueprintCallable`: Exposes the function to Blueprint scripts, allowing it to be called from within Blueprint graphs.
-   `BlueprintPure`: Indicates that the function is a pure computation and does not modify any state, making it safe to use in Blueprint graphs without side effects.
-   `BlueprintImplementableEvent`: Serves as a placeholder function in C++ that can be overridden and implemented in Blueprint.
-   `BlueprintNativeEvent`: Similar to `BlueprintImplementableEvent`, but it also provides a C++ implementation that can be optionally overridden in Blueprint.
-   `Category`: Organizes properties into named categories in the editor for better organization and readability.

#### Common Meta tags

-   `DisplayName`: Sets a custom display name for the function in the Unreal Editor.
-   `Tooltip`: Provides a tooltip description for the function in the Unreal Editor.
-   `ShortToolTip`: Provides a short tooltip description for the function in the Unreal Editor.
-   `AllowPrivateAccess`: Allows access to private members within the class it belongs to.
-   `HideSelfPin`: Hides the "self" pin, which indicates the object on which the function is being called. The "self" pin is automatically hidden on `BlueprintPure` functions that are compatible with the calling Blueprint's Class. Functions that use the `HideSelfPin` Meta Tag frequently also use the `DefaultToSelf` Specifier.
-   `BlueprintInternalUseOnly`: This function is an internal implementation detail, used to implement another function or node. It is never directly exposed in a Blueprint graph.
-   `BlueprintProtected`: This function can only be called on the owning Object in a Blueprint. It cannot be called on another instance.
-   `DeprecatedFunction`: Any Blueprint references to this function will cause compilation warnings telling the user that the function is deprecated. You can add to the deprecation warning message (for example, to provide instructions on replacing the deprecated function) using the `DeprecationMessage` metadata specifier.

#### Examples

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure)
int32 BlueprintPureFunction();

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
int32 BlueprintCallableFunction();

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
int32 BlueprintCallableConstFunction() const;

UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure=false)
int32 BlueprintPureFalseFunction() const;
```

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Doggy Daycare", meta=(ReturnDisplayName = "Success"))
bool TryPetDog(const FName Name);
```

-   `MinimalAPI`: Restricts the class's visibility for export, making it more suitable for engine internal use.
-   `NotBlueprintType`: Prevents the class from being used as a blueprint.

#### Common Meta tags

-   `DisplayName`: Sets a custom display name for the class in the Unreal Editor.
-   `ToolTip`: Provides a tooltip description for the class in the Unreal Editor.
-   `HideCategories`: Hides specific property categories from being displayed in the Unreal Editor.

UCLASS(Blueprintable)
class MyActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "MyActor")
    int32 MyIntProperty;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "MyActor")

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "MyActor")
    void ModifyValue(UPARAM(Ref) int32& ValueToModify)
    {
        // Modify the value passed by reference
